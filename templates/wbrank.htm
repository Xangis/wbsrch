<h3>What is WbRank?</h3>

<p>WbRank is a general measure of a website's popularity on a scale of 0 to 10. The WbSrch search engine uses it as one of the ranking factors in its search results.</p>

<h3>How is it calculated?</h3>

<p>WbRank is determined using an unweighted count of the number of unique domains in the WbSrch search index that link to the target domain. More links result in a higher WbRank. It is calculated on a roughly logarithmic scale, so it takes more links to move from WbRank 3 to WbRank 4 than it does to move from WbRank 1 to WbRank 2.</p>

<h3>Is this the same thing as PageRank?</h3>

<p>No. PageRank is a weighted algorithm. WbRank is unweighted but serves a similar purpose.</p>

<h3>How can I check my site's WbRank?</h3>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://stats.wbsrch.com">stats section</a> where you can check your site's WbRank and a few other SEO-related metrics. We also have an API. It's not public yet, but if you're interested in getting access, you can contact us.</p>

<h3>Are all links counted?</h3>

<p>No. Links from sites excluded from the WbSrch search engine are not counted.</p>

<h3>What about paid links?</h3>

<p>Paid links are fine. That's just called advertising, and we don't have a problem with it.</p>

<h3>What about link farms?</h3>

<p>We tend to block those when we notice them, but they're not as prevalent now as they were in the past.</p>

<h3>Are nofollow links counted?</h3>

<p>Yes. Nofollow isn't a part of the HTML standard and is a silly idea in the first place. If it's a link, then it's meant to be followed.</p>

<h3>Does linking to too many other sites decrease your ranking?</h3>

<p>No. The web was designed around linking to other sites, and we don't want to do anything to discourage that.</p>
