This is a directory that exists as a place to store lists of to-be-crawled URL files.

By default it doesn't contain anything, but the "wget_alexa.sh" script retrieves Alexa
top million URL lists and stores them in the alexa subdirectory.

The "wget_alexa.sh" script gets the Majestic Million and stores it in the majestic 
subdirectory.

The icann subdirectory should contain CZDS zone file downloads.

The verisign directory should contain .com and .name zone file downloads.
