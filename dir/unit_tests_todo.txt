Need to add a teSt for "is unblockable" for domains + excluded sites.

Need to test for both language blocking and porn blocking.

RemoveURLsForDomain or some other method should handle this logic, with maybe a bool
to also delete all parent domains, and automatically check whether the unblockable flag
is set, and/or create block entries.

In other words, don't put all the logic in the admin code.

Perhaps just a recursion flag will do.

Need to test GetRootURL with the new domain extensions for second-level ccTLDs.
