The MaxMind GeoIP legacy databases should be put in this directory.

Failure to do so will cause the site to throw errors when logging searches or domain lookups.

These files should be present:

GeoIPASNum.dat
GeoIP.dat
GeoLiteCity.dat

You can get these files by running geoip_update.sh in the parent directory.
