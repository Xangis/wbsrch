This folder contains scripts for processing various DMOZ RDF dump data.

While DMOZ may no longer be running, the data dump can be used as a decent data source. 
Some of the data is out of date, but it still contains many URLs that can be worth crawling.

Most usefully, it contains batches of URLs that can easily be split out by country/language,
which may be handy if you want to seed a new language index.
